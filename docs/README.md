## Circle
### 1. Area

```
area(r)
```
 The area(r) function calculates the area of ​​a circle with radius.

Formula:

     Area = π * r^2

Description:
- `Area` is the area of the circle.
- `π` (pi) is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 3.14159.
- `r` is the radius of the circle
  
```python
 def area(r):  
    return math.pi * r * r
```

### 2. Perimeter

```
perimeter(r)
```
 The perimeter(r) function calculates the perimeter of a circle. 


Formula:

     Perimeter = 2 * π * r

Description:
- `Perimeter`is the perimeter of the circle.
- `π` (pi) is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 3.14159.
- `r` is the radius of the circle.
  
```python
 def perimeter(r): 
    return 2 * math.pi * r
```


## Rectangle

### 1. Area

```
area(a, b)
```
  The area(a, b) function calculates the area of a rectangle.

Formula:

     Area = a * b

Description:
- `Area` is the area of the rectangle.
- `a` is the length of one side of the rectangle.
- `b` is the length of the other side of the rectangle.
  
```python
def area(a, b):
    return a * b
```
### 2. Perimeter

```
perimeter(a, b)
```
The perimeter(a, b) function calculates the perimeter of a rectangle.

Formula:

     Perimeter = 2 * (a + b)

Description:
- `Perimeter` is the perimeter of the rectangle.
- `a` is the length of one side of the rectangle.
- `b` is the length of the other side of the rectangle.
    '''
  
```python
def perimeter(a, b):
    return 2 * (a + b)
```
## Square

### 1. Area

```
area(a)
```
The area(a) function calculates the area of a square.

Formula:

     Area = a * a

Description:
- `Area` is the area of the square.
- `a` is the length of one side of the square.
  
```python
def area(a):
    return a * a
```
### 2. Perimeter

```
perimeter(a)
```
The perimeter(a) function calculates the perimeter of a square.

Formula:

     Perimeter = 4 * a

Description:
- `Perimeter` is the perimeter of the square.
-  `a` is the length of one side of the square.
    '''
  
```python
def perimeter(a):
    return 4 * a
```

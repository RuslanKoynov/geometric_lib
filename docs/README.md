## Math formulas

### Area
- Circle: S = πR²
- Rectangle: S = ab
- Square: S = a²
- Triangle: S = (ah)/2

### Perimeter
- Circle: P = 2πR
- Rectangle: P = 2a + 2b
- Square: P = 4a
- Triangle: P = a + b + c

## general description of the solution
In general, the solution consists of two stages:
1. The function receives a certain number(s), which are the length of some elements of the figure.
2. Mathematical operations are performed with the given number(s), with the help of which the area or volume of the figure is calculated (depending on the formulas)
3. The program returns the result.

def area(a, b):
    '''
    The area(a, b) function calculates the area of a rectangle given its two side lengths, a and b. 
    It uses the formula:
    
    Area = a * b
    
    Where:
    - Area is the area of the rectangle.
    - a is the length of one side of the rectangle.
    - b is the length of the other side of the rectangle.
    '''
    return a * b 

def perimeter(a, b):
    '''
    The perimeter(a, b) function calculates the perimeter of a rectangle given its two side lengths, a and b. 
    It uses the formula:

    Perimeter = 2 * (a + b)

    Where:
    - Perimeter is the perimeter of the rectangle.
    - a is the length of one side of the rectangle.
    - b is the length of the other side of the rectangle.
    ''' 
    return 2 * (a + b)

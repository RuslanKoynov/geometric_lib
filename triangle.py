def area(a, h): 
    '''
    The area(a, h) function calculates the area of a triangle given its base length a and height h. 
    It uses the formula:

    Area = (a * h) / 2

    Where:
    - Area is the area of the triangle.
    - a is the length of the base of the triangle.
    - h is the height of the triangle, measured perpendicular to the base.
    '''
    return a * h / 2 

def perimeter(a, b, c): 
    '''
    The perimeter(a, b, c) function calculates the perimeter of a triangle given the lengths of its three sides, a, b, and c. 
    It uses the formula:

    Perimeter = a + b + c

    Where:
    - Perimeter is the perimeter of the triangle.
    - a, b, and c are the lengths of the three sides of the triangle.
    '''
    return a + b + c
